# Introduction to Programming

## :mortar_board: Intended learning outcomes

At the end of the session you will be able to:

-	Explain the function and utility of variables, conditional statements, and loops.
-	Write a program using C# (a popular programming language).

## What is Programming?

Programming is a key part of software development. But it not the only part! We will spend a considerable amount of time on this course learning how to write programs. But it is important to remember that there is more to software development than programming (for example, we have already covered version control, and we will explore other aspects of software development in later weeks).

Equally, programming is valuable skill beyond software development. Take a look at the table below to see how programming is related to different roles in the UK Cyber Security Councils Careers Framework.

| Secure System Development | Digital Forensics | Secure Operations | Cyber Security Generalist |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Programming will be a key part of your job role and is essential to developing software. | You will need to be able to read and understand code as a part of your investigations. | You will use scripting languages as a part of your job role (probably to automate things). | As a generalist you will be expected to have some knowledge of many areas, including programming! |

But what does the act of programming actually involve? Put briefly, programming is the act of writing instructions (code) for a computer to follow and solve problems on our behalf.

Much of modern society is underpinned by computers running these kinds of programs:

- Switching on a computer or using your phone.
- Browsing the Web and liking something on social media.
- Setting the timer on a microwave.
- Making a withdrawal from a cash machine or paying with a card directly.
- And much much more!

## Programming languages

We can't give computers instructions like we would give a human instructions. Natural languages like English are too ambiguous; even as humans we can interpret the meaning of natural language in different ways, so what chance does a computer have! Even language models, like ChatGPT, which are designed to handle natural language inputs demonstrate this point, and often misinterpret the meaning of natural language.

At the lowest level, computers operate on binary code (a sequence of 0s and 1s), which is unambiguous. However, writing programs in binary code would take a long time and simply wouldn't be practical. So we use programming languages that are easier for humans to write and that can be transformed into binary code to give instructions to computers instead.

There are lots of different programming languages, but don't worry! Programming languages have lots in common and learning a new programming language isn't comprable to learning a new natural language (E.g., Spanish).

In this course, we are going to focus on the C# programming language. C# is a very versatile language and can be used to develop web, mobile, and Internet of Things applications as well as games.
