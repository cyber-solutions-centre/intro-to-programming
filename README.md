## What is Programming?

Programming is a key part of software development. But it not the only part! We will spend a considerable amount of time on this course thinking about programming. But it is important to remember that there is more to software development than programming (for example, we have already covered version control, and we will explore other aspects of software development in later weeks).

Equally, programming is valuable skill beyond software development. Take a look at the table below to see how programming is related to different roles in the UK Cyber Security Councils Careers Framework.

| Secure System Development | Digital Forensics | Secure Operations | Cyber Security Generalist |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Programming will be a key part of your job role and is essential to developing software. | You will need to be able to read and understand code as a part of your investigations. | You will use scripting languages as a part of your job role (probably to automate things). | As a generalist you will be expected to have some knowledge of many areas, including programming! |
