# Learning activity #4: Binary Arithmetic Operators

In this activity you are going to solve a puzzle to demonstrate your understanding of comparison operators.

Note that this is learning actvitiy #5, and it is assumed you have already created a local version of this repository in learning activity #1.

Follow the steps below to complete the activity and complete the extension if you have time.

## ðŸ‘£ Steps

1. Navigate to **activities/5-comparison-operators/src** using the explorer and open the **Program.cs** file.

</br>

2. Examine the contents of the file. What do you think it will output when we run this program?

</br>

3. Run the program. Remember, to do this, open a new terminal (`CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `'`), navigate to **activities/5-comparison-operators/src** (`cd activities/5-comparison-operators/src`), and enter: `dotnet run`.

</br>

4. Examine the contents of the terminal. Is the output of the program what you were expecting?

    <summary>What should you be seeing as the output?</summary>

    This time you should get some warnings:

    ```
    warning CS0219: The variable 'x' is assigned but its value is never used
    warning CS0219: The variable 'y' is assigned but its value is never used
    ```

    Warnings are different from error messages. A program will work and execute when warnings are present. However, it is still worth taking note of warnings as they may highlight a mistake.

    In this case, we get warnings because the our variables `x` and `y` have not been used. We have declared and assigned them but we haven't yet done anything meaningful with them. Luckily, we will be addressing this in the next step.

5. Write statements to output `True` and `False` to the terminal using the `x` and `y` variables along with comparison operators of your choosing (and confirm that your change works using 'dotnet run'.).

    To output to the terminal use `Console.WriteLine`. The comparison operators we have covered are: `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`.

    Something like this will work (but there are other solutions):

    ```c#
    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            int x = 100;
            int y = 50;

            Console.WriteLine(x > y);
            Console.WriteLine(x < y);
        }
    }
    ```
